# Contributing to ReValuate

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

ReValuate is an AI-powered Exam Revaluation System that helps students get fair, transparent grading using Gemini Vision AI. We welcome contributions from the community.

---
##  Deployment Note for Contributors

**Why is the Live Demo incomplete?**
The codebase includes a fully functional Redis + BullMQ background worker system for AI processing. However, we have **intentionally not deployed the Worker Service** to the live production environment to avoid monthly cloud infrastructure costs.
![Payment Proof For Worker](/images_of_website/Payment_proof.png)

###  How to Test AI Features (Local Development)
Since the worker is offline in production, you **must run the project locally** to see the AI grading in action.

1.  **Start Redis** (Ensure your Upstash or local Redis is running).
2.  **Start the Worker:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run worker
    ```
3.  **Start the API & Frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
 

##  Current Subjects
The system currently supports the following standard subjects. If adding a new one, ensure you update the Database ENUMs and Frontend Selectors.

*   **UX** - User Experience Design
*   **AIML** - AI & Machine Learning
*   **PMA** - Project Management & Analysis
*   **COA** - Computer Organization & Architecture
*   **EHS** - Environmental Health & Safety

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the exact versions to avoid conflicts:
*   **Node.js**: v20.x (LTS)
*   **Redis**: v7.x (or Upstash Serverless)
*   **PostgreSQL**: v14+ (via Supabase)

## Good First Issues
New to the project? Try these:
1.  **Validation**: Add regex validation for "Student Register Number" (Must be alphanumeric, e.g., `REG2023`).
2.  **UI Polish**: Improve the "Loading Skeleton" for the Dashboard charts.
3.  **Logs**: Add clearer console logs in `authMiddleware.js` for failed token attempts.

##  Tech Stack & Architecture

* **AI:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (Vision & Text)
* **Payment:** Stripe Integration
* **File Storage:** Supabase Storage

**Architecture Type:** Hybrid Monolith + Microservice Workers

##  Quick Start (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:
- **Node.js** v20+ ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** v8+ (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** ([Download](https://git-scm.com/))
- **Redis** (Local or Docker) **OR** Upstash account (recommended)
- **Supabase Account** ([Sign up](https://supabase.com))
- **Google AI API Key** ([Get key](https://ai.google.dev/))

---

### Step 1: Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub (click "Fork" button)

# Clone YOUR fork
git clone  https://github.com/quantumstack-labs/Smart_Revaluation_System.git
cd revaluate

# Add upstream remote (to sync with main repo)
git remote add upstream  https://github.com/quantumstack-labs/Smart_Revaluation_System.git
```

---

### Step 2: Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Edit `backend/.env` with your credentials:

```bash
# Database (Supabase)
# IMPORTANT: Create your OWN free Supabase project. Do NOT use production credentials.
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[YOUR_PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].supabase.co:5432/postgres
SUPABASE_URL=https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=[YOUR_ANON_KEY]

# Redis (Upstash)
REDIS_URL=rediss://default:[PASSWORD]@[HOST].upstash.io:6379

# AI (Google Gemini)
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza[YOUR_KEY]

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=[GENERATE_RANDOM_64_CHAR_STRING]

# Payment (Test Mode)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[YOUR_KEY]


# Server
PORT=port_number
NODE_ENV=development
```

**How to get credentials:**
- **Supabase**: Create project → Settings → API → Copy URL & Anon Key
- **Upstash**: Create Redis database → Copy REST URL
- **Gemini**: Visit [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) → Get API Key
- **Stripe**: Sign up → Settings → API Keys (use test mode)
---

### Step 3: Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Edit `frontend/.env`:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=[YOUR_KEY]
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://[PROJECT-ID].supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[YOUR_ANON_KEY]
```

---

### Step 4: Run Services

**You need THREE terminals running simultaneously:**

#### Terminal 1: Backend API Server
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev


#### Terminal 2: Background Workers
```bash
cd backend
npm run worker


#### Terminal 3: Frontend Dev Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev

---

### Step 6: Verify Installation

1. **Frontend**: Open `http://localhost:5173` → You should see the landing page
2. **Backend API**: Visit `http://localhost:5000/api/health` → Should return `{"status":"ok"}`
3. **Create Test Account**: 
   - Sign up as Student
   - Sign up as Teacher (use different email)

---

## 🧪 How to Test Your Changes

### Test Scenario 1: Student Upload Flow

```bash
1. Login as Student
2. Go to Dashboard → Apply for Revaluation
3. Complete payment (use test card: 1111 1111 1111 1111)
4. Upload answer script (PDF or images)
```

### Test Scenario 2: AI Grading Flow

```bash
1. Login as Teacher
2. Upload Answer Key (Answer Keys tab)
3. Go to pending requests
4. Click Purple (Grade) button
5. Check Worker terminal for AI processing logs
6. Verify AI feedback appears in grading workspace
```

### Test Scenario 3: Background Worker

```bash
# In Worker terminal, you should see:
[INFO] Job received: embedding-queue
[INFO] Processing answer key: CS101
[INFO] Text extracted: 1234 characters
[INFO] Job completed successfully
```

- **React**: Functional components with hooks (no class components)
- **Naming**: 
  - Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `studentId`)
  - Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `StudentDashboard`)
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `API_BASE_URL`)
